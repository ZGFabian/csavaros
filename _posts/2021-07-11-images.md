`ggplot2::ggsave` has reasonable defaults for image width and height that are equal to the size of the current graphic window. In my case it is the `X11` device, which has a default value of 7x7 inches with 300 dpi that results in a 2100x2100 pixel png image. Obviously it is too large for web publishing or to display on a monitor, that typically has lower resolution. 
There are several options to optimize your image. Most importantly you can always calibrate `ggsave` arguments to your need. However, in some cases, it is more convenient to modify an original, high-quality image using external tools, such as graphics applications or using R's dedicated packages to image post-processing. In this post I describe how I use Linux command line tools and `magick` package `image_resize` function.

## Creating a basic plot with `ggplot`

First, I create and save an image with `ggplot` using the well-known `mtcars` dataset from `ggplot2`.

```r
pacman::p_load(ggplot2, magick) ## this will load (and install if required) libraries
si <- sessionInfo() ## Info on OS, obscure libraries (BLAS, LAPACK), R versions and attached packages
print(si, locale = FALSE) ## Omit irrelevant and boring locale info
## Plotting weight (in 1000 lbs), miles/(US) gallon and number of cylinders
p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg, color = as.factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point()
p
ggsave("p.png", p)
## Saving 7 x 7 in image
```

## Getting to know the dimensions and size of saved image

Show saved file size and other info
```r
file.size(pattern = "p.png") ## in 45511 B (byte)
file.info(pattern = "p.png") ## other file info (group, modiification time, etc)
```

You can always invoke a system command within an R session with `system()`. To get basic info on saved image (`p.png`) one can use `file` command which prints dimensions (2100x2100) and or `identify` that provides size in B (45338 B). Note that the latter program is a member of the ImageMagick suite of tools.

```r
system(command = "file p.png")
## p.png: PNG image data, 2100 x 2100, 8-bit colormap, non-interlaced
system(command = "identify p.png")
## p.png PNG 2100x2100 2100x2100+0+0 8-bit sRGB 256c 45338B 0.000u 0:00.015
```

Other system tools available on most Linux distros:
- `exiv2`, a program to read and write Exif and other metadata, image comments.
- `mediainfo` display detailed information on image on different output format like XML, JSON, HTML.


### Resize using `Magick` - R package

`Magick` package is available from CRAN and it is based on Magick++ C++ graphics library. See details at project [pages](https://github.com/ropensci/magick) and [package vignette](https://docs.ropensci.org/magick/articles/intro.html)


The following command throws:
```r
## Error: The 'image' argument is not a magick image object.
image_resize(image = "p.png", geometry = "800x800")
```
First we should create an image object by reading in our saved image,

```r
im1 <- image_read(path = "p.png")
```
than we can resize, view and save the new image:

```r
im2 <- image_resize(image = im1, geometry = "800x800")
print(im2)
# X11 only
image_display(im2)
## System dependent
options(browser = "firefox") # choose whatever browser you like
image_browse(image = im2) # open in new browser tab
image_write(im2, path = "p_resized.png") # saving new image
system("xdg-open p_resized.png") # open with system default app like sxiv
```

### Imagemagick (within R)

Use [`ImageMagick`](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) system tools to convert, resize and manipulate images from command line.
Installation is simple, e.g. on Debian-based distros: `sudo apt-get install imagemagick`, on Arch-like distros `sudo pacman -S imagemagick`.

```r
## running system command from imagemagick tool:
system("convert -geometry 800x p.png p_800x.png")
```

### Appendix - Sessioninfo

```r
si <- sessionInfo()
print(si, locale = FALSE)
```
