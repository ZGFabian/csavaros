Rstat is great in creating data visualizations even in interactive ones. However, publishing the results in Jekyll can be a challenge<a href="#notes">#</a> and sometimes easier to work directly with python and javascripts. Look at this simple example.


## Python part

```python
import plotly.express as px
df = px.data.gapminder()

fig2 = px.scatter(df.query("year==2007"), x="gdpPercap", y="lifeExp",
	         size="pop", color="continent",
                  hover_name="country", log_x=True, size_max=60,
                  labels={"gdpPercap": "GDP per capita (on log scale)",
                          "pop": "Population size",
                          "lifeExp": "Life expectancy"},
                  title="A gapminder classic: bubble chart")

# fig2.show()
fig2.write_html("bubble-chart.html", include_plotlyjs="cdn")
```

`include_plotlyjs="cdn"` ensures that plotly.js will be served externally as: 

```html
<script src="https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-latest.min.js"></script>
``` 


## Jekyll include

{% raw %}
```liquid
{% include plots/bubble-chart.html %}
```

The above snippet look for `bubble-chart.html` in `_includes/plots` folder and Jekyll generates the plot:

{% endraw %}

{% include plots/bubble-chart.html %}
