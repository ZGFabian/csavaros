This post is about subsetting and recoding (assigning) a value in a data frame containing some missing data.

Subsetting and re-coding in base R are *relatively* straightforward. Emphasis on *relatively* because subsetting is "hard to master because you need to internalise a number of interrelated concepts:

 - There are six ways to subset atomic vectors.
 - There are three subsetting operators, [[, [, and $.
 - Subsetting operators interact differently with different vector types (e.g.,
   atomic vectors, lists, factors, matrices, and data frames).
 - Subsetting can be combined with assignment." ([H. Wickham's Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/subsetting.html))

## Default case: no missing data (NAs) in a data frame (df)

Consider the following dataframe:

```{r}
df0 <- data.frame(col1 = c(1:3), col2 = c("cat", "mouse", "dog"))
df0
```

And you want to recode - that is to say assign a new value to - "cat" in row 1, column 2 (col2). You can do it by subsetting either by (1) value (i.e. "cat") or (2) by index like `df0[1,2]`

```{r}
df0[df0$col2 == "cat", ]$col2 <- "lion"
## same as df0[1,2] or df0[1,]$col2
df0[which(df0$col2 == "cat"), ]
df0
```

We have subset rows (observations) based on logical tests. To do so one should use double equal sign (`==`) as the single one is reserved for assignment. (`=` is the same as `<-`) 

## Subsetting an "NA-polluted" df

However things can be a little bit more complicated when your data frame contains some missing values (`NA`s). Lets create a new version of our primitive dataset with an additional `NA` value and try again to change "cat" to "lion" with the above methods.

### The so called "rabbit hole": subsetting by value.

```{r, error = TRUE}
df1 <- data.frame(col1 = c(1:4), col2 = c("cat", "mouse", "dog", NA))
df1[df1$col2 == "cat", ]$col2 <- "lion"
```

Note the **error**: "cat" has not become "lion" because "missing values are not allowed in subscripted assignments of data frames".

### Subsetting by index value is just fine for re-coding

```{r}
which(df1$col2 == "cat")
which[(df1$col2 == "cat"), ]$col2
df1[which(df1$col2 == "cat"), ]$col2 <- "lion" ## same as df1[1,2] or df1[1,]$col2
df1
```

### Another way out from rabbit hole

Nevertheless, at the cost of some additional typing one can still subset a df by value:

```{r}
df1[df1$col2 == "lion" & !is.na(df1$col2), ]$col2
```

### Beyond base R

```{r}
df1
df1[df1$col2 == "lion",] # NAs are included
dplyr::filter(df1$col2 == "lion") # no applicable method for 'filter' applied to an object of class "logical"

df1 %>%
  filter(col2 == "lion") # Fine! Row filtered

df1 %>%
  filter(col2 == "lion")$col2 # 3 arguments passed to '$' which requires 2

(df1 %>% filter(col2 == "lion"))$col2
(df1 %>% filter(col2 == "lion"))$col2 <- "cat"


str(df1$col2 == "lion")
df <- data.frame(colA = c(1, 2, 3, NA, NA),
                 colB = c("a", "b", "c", "d", NA))
df[df$colB == "b", ]
df[df$colA == 1, ]
library(dplyr)
df %>% filter(colA == 2)
df %>% filter(colA == 2)$colB #Error in .$filter(colA == 2) : 3 arguments passed to '$' which requires 2
(df %>% filter(colB == "a"))$colB # Bingo!!
```
