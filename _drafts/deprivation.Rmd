With the exception of Hungary severe material deprivation rate (SMDR) declined unanimously after joining to the EU. Hungary was hit harder by the social outcomes of 2008 fincial crisis than Czechia, Poland or Slovakia. SDMR grew from n in 2008 to N in 2013. However, the austerity measures of social-liberal government and unorthodox economic policy of the second OrbÃ¡n cabinet resuled in a decline of SDMR after 2012 in Hungary. Poland was far from the most effective in reducing SDMR among V4s.
