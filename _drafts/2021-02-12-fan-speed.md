title: Controling fan speed ThinkPad laptops
layout: single
---

I have an old laptop. Config:

tlp package to manage power
tlp-stat to get info
thinkpad_acpi kernel modul
lsmod | grep think
thinkfan package - hard and risky properly configure Arch wiki is obsolote and no copy-paste reasonable defaults.

however you can check and control fan speed manually

cat /proc/acpi/ibm/fan

[pepin ~]# cat /proc/acpi/ibm/fan
status:		enabled
speed:		3735
level:		auto
commands:	level <level> (<level> is 0-7, auto, disengaged, full-speed)
commands:	enable, disable
commands:	watchdog <timeout> (<timeout> is 0 (off), 1-120 (seconds))

As root user (not simply with sudo) one can control the fan speed:

1. Change to root account with sudo -i or sudo su then
2. echo level 7 > /proc/acpi/ibm/fan
3. Probably you can hear, but verify increased ventilator speed
[pepin ~]# cat /proc/acpi/ibm/fan
status:		enabled
speed:		4549
level:		7
commands:	level <level> (<level> is 0-7, auto, disengaged, full-speed)
commands:	enable, disable
commands:	watchdog <timeout> (<timeout> is 0 (off), 1-120 (seconds))
