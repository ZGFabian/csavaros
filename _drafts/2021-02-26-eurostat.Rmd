## Plotting severe material deprivation rate (SMDR)
I plotted EUROSTAT data on SMDR with a few line of R codes using `eurostat` and `tidyverse`.

```{r, setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7, fig.path="../assets/img/21-02-22-eurostat/")
```

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(eurostat)
# devtools::install_github("zgfabian/kimberlite")
library(kimberlite)
```
 
```{r, p1, include=TRUE, message = FALSE}
df <- get_eurostat("ilc_mddd12", time_format = "num")
v4 <- c("CZ", "HU", "PL", "SK")
df <- df %>%
  filter(time >= 2005 & wstatus == "POP" &
         age == "Y_GE18" & geo %in% v4 &
         sex == "T")
p1 <- df %>%
  ggplot(aes(time, values, color = geo)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_kimberlite() +
  theme_kimberlite()
p1
```

```{r, hch}
library(highcharter)
df %>%
  hc_chart(df, "line",  hcaes(x = time, y = values, group = geo))
```

```{r}
library(plotly)
fig <- plot_ly(df, x=~time, y=~values, color = ~geo, type = "scatter", mode = "lines")
fig
htmlwidgets::saveWidget(as_widget(fig), "index.html")
```


```{r, echo = FALSE, results="asis"}
df %>%
  #  filter(geo == "HU") %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = geo, values_from = values) %>%
  select(-wstatus, -age, -sex) %>%
  arrange(time) %>%
  knitr::kable(., caption = "SMDR between 2005-2019")
```


{: .notice--info}
**material deprivation rate** is the percentage of the population that cannot afford at least three of the following nine items: (1) to pay their rent, mortgage or utility bills; (2) to keep their home adequately warm; (3) to face unexpected expenses; (4) to eat meat or proteins regularly; (5) to go on holiday; (6) a television set; (7) a washing machine; (8) a car; (9) a telephone. **Severe material deprivation rate** is defined as the enforced inability to pay for at least four of the above-mentioned items. _Source:_ [EUROSTAT glossary](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Glossary:Severe_material_deprivation_rate)

<!--
With the exception of Hungary severe material deprivation rate (SMDR) declined unanimously after joining to the EU. Hungary was hit harder by the social outcomes of 2008 financial crisis than Czechia, Poland or Slovakia. SMDR grew from n in 2008 to N in 2013. However, the austerity measures of social-liberal government and unorthodox economic policy of the second OrbÃ¡n cabinet resulted in a decline of SMDR after 2012 in Hungary. Poland was far from the most effective in reducing SMDR among V4s.
