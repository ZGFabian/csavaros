With the exception of Hungary severe material deprivation rate (SMDR) declined unaWnimously in V4 countries after the EU accession. Hungary  was hit harder by the social outcomes of 2008 financial crisis than Czechia, Poland or Slovakia. SMDR grew from 17 percent in 2008 to 26 percent point in 2013. However, the austerity measures of social-liberal government and unorthodox economic policy of the second Orbán cabinet resulted in a decline of SMDR after 2013 in Hungary. However, Poland was a real "fairy tale"[^1] among V4s in reducing SMDR to one tenth of its 2005 value. 

[^1]:To paraphrase György Matolcsy, president of the National Bank of Hungary who gave an interview to CNN in 2012. He used this term for Hungary's economic prospects.

The following plots on SMDR were made with R using `eurostat` and `tidyverse` packages with my ricing.

```{r, setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7, fig.path="../assets/img/21-02-22-eurostat/")
```

```{r, libs, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(eurostat)
# devtools::install_github("zgfabian/kimberlite")
library(kimberlite)
```
 
```{r, p1, include=TRUE, message = FALSE}
df <- get_eurostat("ilc_mddd12", time_format = "num")
v4 <- c("CZ", "HU", "PL", "SK")
df1 <- df %>%
  filter(time >= 2005 & wstatus == "POP" &
         age == "Y_GE18" & geo %in% v4 &
         sex == "T")
p1 <- df1 %>%
  ggplot(aes(time, values, color = geo, shape = geo)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  labs(title = "Severe material deprivation rate in V4 countries",
       subtitle = "2005-2019",
       caption = "data source: Eurostat") +
  scale_color_kimberlite() +
  theme_kimberlite() +
  theme(axis.title = element_blank(), legend.title = element_blank())
p1
```

```{r, kbl, echo = FALSE, results="asis"}
df1 %>%
  #  filter(geo == "HU") %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = geo, values_from = values) %>%
  select(-wstatus, -age, -sex) %>%
  arrange(time) %>%
  knitr::kable(., caption = "SMDR between 2005-2019")
```
