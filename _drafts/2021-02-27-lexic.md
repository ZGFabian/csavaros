Lexic (currently) provides offline dictionnaries to Emacs by integrating sdcv CLI utility. 

1. Install Tecosaur [`lexic`](https://github.com/tecosaur/lexic) package. (In Doom Emacs add package! to packages.el). This is how it works:

2. `lexic` requires `sdcv`, a simple, cross-platform text-based utility for working with dictionaries in StarDict format. See install instructions on [ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Sdcv).
3. There are a lot of free dictionnaries available from [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20200702000038/http://download.huzheng.org/). The standard location of sdcv dictionnaries is `/usr/share/stardict/dic`. Also,there are dictionaries in Linux repositories.
4. Configure `lexic` in emacs (by editing `config.el`) as seen in Tecosaur literate config file.
5. Check the  of `lexic-dictionary-specs` variable (`SPC-h-v`) to see what it expects for other dictionaries supported by default.

- [dictmaster](https://github.com/tuxor1337/dictmaster) - A simple tool that automatically fetches dictionary data from different offline and online sources. The dictionaries are prettified and automatically converted to stardict format. The input format might be some XML or HTML format. Zipped data is also supported and there is basic support for Babylon dictionaries.
- [translate-shell](https://github.com/soimort/translate-shell) is nice from CLI, but there is Xu Chunyang's [`translate-shell.el`](https://github.com/xuchunyang/translate-shell.el).
