# Basics

## What is Jekyll?

> [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is a static website generator. I use it for my personal website at [zgfabian.github.com](http://zgfabian.github.com).

> The `xaringan` R package is an R Markdown extension based on the JavaScript library [remark.js](https://remarkjs.com) to generate HTML5 presentations of a different style. It's been developed by [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.org/en/).

  - presenter mode and cloning: show the notes on your screen and the clone on the projector
  - timer

<a id = "a">a</a>(*You can try it* **now**)

???

Here's a list of stuff to say:

- some notes to myself
- more stuff


# Configuration in Jekyll

xaringan presentations are [Rmarkdown]() files. I configured Jekyll to exclude them from rendering. Cf. Jekyll's `_config.yml`:

```yml
exclude:
  - "*.Rmd"
  ...
```

Usually, I keep my Rmd files under `_drafts` folder, so it is not served by Jekyll. I am also keeping out this folder from github deployment by adding to `.gitignore` file.

???

Wow, this even does presenter notes.

## File locations

- remark.js is served from prject folder
- header customization for proper favicon display



> @sammo3182 Sorry, but I don't have time to teach you how to use Github Pages. The xaringan output is an .html file associated with a libs directory(or *_files). Upload these two things to any host.

TODO: more styling
