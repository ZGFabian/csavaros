# Basics

## What is Jekyll?

> [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is a static website generator. I use it for my personal website at [zgfabian.github.com](http://zgfabian.github.com).

## What is Xaringan?

> The `xaringan` R package is an R Markdown extension based on the JavaScript library [remark.js](https://remarkjs.com) to generate HTML5 presentations of a different style. It's been developed by [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.org/en/).

# First steps


```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("xaringan")
#xaringan:::list_css()
```

xaringan presentations are [Rmarkdown]() files. I configured Jekyll to exclude them from rendering. Cf. Jekyll's `_config.yml`:

```yml
exclude:
  - "*.Rmd"
  ...
```

Usually, I keep my Rmd files under `_drafts` folder, so it is not served by Jekyll. I am also keeping out this folder from github deployment by adding to `.gitignore` file.

???

Wow, this even does presenter notes. 

```yml
xxx: jshdfj
```

> @sammo3182 Sorry, but I don't have time to teach you how to use Github Pages. The xaringan output is an .html file associated with a libs directory(or *_files). Upload these two things to any host.
